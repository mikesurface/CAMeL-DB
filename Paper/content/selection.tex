\section{Selection}

Current implementations of crowdsourcing in databases such as CrowdDB \cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/FranklinKKRX11} and Qurk{DBLP:conf/sigmod/MarcusWKMM11} have focused primarily on using human computation at the query processing level, enabling human workers to fill in missing tables when the data is queried.  The query itself allocates which entries should be modified by humans. 
\sean{CASTLE does all crowdsourcing in advance to speed up query processing.  Alternatively, we need to decide for ourselves the appropriate items to crowdsource.}
