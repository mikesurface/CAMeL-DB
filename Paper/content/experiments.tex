\noindent Selection: Compare accuracy before and after replacing tokens with ground truth. \newline

\noindent Selection: Compare accuracy before and after re-running inference. \newline

\noindent Selection: Measure accuracy vs. clusters asked to find where diminishing returns occur. \newline

\noindent Integration: Compare DS vs. MV for 3, 5, 7, and 9 Turkers per question. \newline

\noindent Integration: Find appropriate entropy threshold to use as decision boundary. \newline

\noindent Integration: Compare accuracy before, after w/o entropy threshold, and after applying entropy. threshold.
