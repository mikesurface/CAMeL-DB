\section{Aggregation}

\noindent\sean{Introduction into quality control and using redundancy to improve performance.}


\noindent\sean{Why aren't we content to use MV?}

\subsection{Evaluating Turker Quality}

\noindent\sean{Intermediate table CrowdQuality(workerID,quality) generated from HIT sets using Dawid-Skene}. 

\subsection{Bayesian Aggregation}

\noindent\sean{Prior initialized in evidence table.  Bayesian approach multiplies prior by new evidence and stores conditional back into evidence table.}

\subsection{Entropy Thresholding}

\noindent\sean{Improving trustworthiness of evidence by removing values above a certain entropy threshold.}
