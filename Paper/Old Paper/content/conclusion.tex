\section{Conclusion}
CrowdPillar is a graphical model-based PDB system designed to handle uncertain data and administer Amazon Mechanical Turk in the resolution of the most uncertain parts of the data.  Experiments were tested on 5000 bibliographic sequences that required labeling.  CrowdPillar was able to effectively select sequences most in need of correction and increase accuracy greatly by correcting just a single node in each one.  While having the worker label the entire sequence is a highly laborous task, by asking a question at only one token we were able to increase accuracy by a total of 7.2\%.  The fact that accuracy increases most within the smallest number of questions shows CrowdPillar is putting priority on the most incorrect ones first even without access to ground truth.

Future directions of research include the testing on additional graphical models such as Bayesian Networks as well as additional scoring and selection metrics.  In addition, we wish to explore new application domains including image annotation and entity resolution.
