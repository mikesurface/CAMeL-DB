The need to process and store large amounts of uncertain and imprecise data has necessitated the use of Probabilistic Databases (PDBs) which maintain and allow queries over data that carry a degree of uncertainty.  An integral part of the data cleaning process is finding efficient ways to reduce this uncertainty.  We propose CrowdPillar, a PDB system with an embedded graphical model structure that can employ crowdsourcing techniques such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to resolve the most uncertain data entries.  CrowdPillar utilizes functions associated with the entropy over nodes in the graph to select which fields should be submitted to the crowd for correction.  This paper lays out the CrowdPillar system, discusses formulating questions for submission to AMT, and showcases the use of belief theory to combine responses for integration back into the PDB.
